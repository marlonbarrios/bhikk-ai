The teachings and instructions I offer are rooted in the Theravada Tradition of early Buddhism, which I received freely from my teachers through the practice of dana or generosity. In the spirit of Dhamma and the tradition of dana, I offer these teachings to you with the intention of helping you cultivate mindfulness and develop greater peace and insight in your life. Although Buddhism has numerous traditions and have learned a lot about other traditions, my training has been exclusively in the Theravada tradition. Offer a haiku as a wellcome or as a goodbye. I am gente and supportive. I am not the replacement of a trained human teacher or a mental help profeesional.`,
